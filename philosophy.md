My goal: I aim to enable students to grasp the threshold concepts in my course, and to learn the skills through which these concepts are applied to solve real problems.

How do I accomplish this? I define three sub-goals:

1. Get students excited so that they are motivated to engage with the subject matter.
2. Give students the lay of the land, so that they have the bigger picture.
3. Equip students to build up their own knowledge, by showing them where to find and how to process the relevant resources.

This teaching mission statement is based in part on (Case, 2019) and (Brunton, 2020). My main goal is to facilitate learning by making a new area accessible to students. To do this, it is essential to break the area down into their threshold concepts (Meyer and Land, 2003; see Knowledge). These concepts serve as building blocks around which a curriculum can be developed. Students should then be enabled to learn the tools and skills to apply these concepts to real problems (see Context). The question then is *how* I enable and equip students? This leads to the three sub-goals.

### 1. Get students excited

Excitement leads to engagement which leads to active learning, where a student makes the work their own. Without being excited, students won't be motivated to engage with the material. I [use humour](https://youtu.be/DW5C3eqAFQM?t=30) to keep the class awake and make myself approachable. I share my own passion for the work. I interleave slides with writing on the blackboard or a tablet. And I try to show practical demos and examples to spark an interest, e.g. demos using language and music (see Students).

### 2. Give students the lay of the land, so that they have the bigger picture

A big struggle when confronted with a new area is to get the bigger picture. I have seen even strong students struggle to acquire threshold concepts if they don't have a macro-level view of where and how micro-level concepts fall within the field and relate to one another. As a practical tool to structure lectures in this way, I have been increasingly relying on the idea of moving around on the semantic plane (see Growth).

For this sub-goal, I think it is also essential to meet students where they are at. This is called developmental teaching (Pratt, 1998), which I associate with strongly. To know how to give the students an overview of what you are going to study, it is important to know something about their background (see Growth). Concretely, this involves knowing what courses they took before, and also adapting to shortcomings in previous teaching as you become aware of them during your course.

### 3. Equip students to build up their own knowledge

Equipped with the lay of the land, students need to be able to build up the details as they become relevant to the problems they are facing. A lecturer can teach this by example, showing students how and where to find the relevant material and how to process it. Concretely, this involves structuring your course website clearly, pointing students to the relevant parts of the textbook, and highlighting when they are dealing with a threshold concept. By showing students where to find and how to process the relevant resources, we are equipping them to become lifelong learners. Increasingly, I try to intentionally structure my courses to require students to engage with the material themselves (see Future).

At a postgraduate level, we have an even more direct way to mentor students to become lifelong learners. For these students, it is even more important to learn how to find and navigate resources themselves in order to identify and acquire threshold concepts on their own. This I try to do by example even more (e.g. in journal reading groups with my students), only providing light guidance when needed. To borrow from [Prof Johan Fourie](https://www.johanfourie.com/teaching/), I see myself as a Wand Dispenser: I provide the wizards of the future (research students) with the appropriate wands (skills, tools) in order to do magic of their own (research, exploration).
