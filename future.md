### ML4Ed: Machine learning for education

I do not think machine learning (ML) will solve all the world's problems. But I do think that if we equip students with the necessary skills to apply ML to specific problems in their own local contexts, it could add massive value to society. To teach this by example, I will continue to apply ML in my own specific domain: education. I am particularly excited about using ML for automatic assessments at scale.

### Post-COVID teaching

While extremely challenging and highlighting the benefits of in-person teaching, the pandemic also forced lecturers to develop new ways of structuring curricula and delivering content. How can we integrate some of these new practices with more conventional in-classroom approaches?

I am still thinking through this and have prototyped a few ideas. Making or curating short videos on threshold concepts will help students outside of the classroom. When we moved back to semi-in-person meetings at the start of 2022, I also experimented with a flipped classroom for DatA414. To encourage students to actually go through the content before the lecture, I started each lecture with a short class test before then taking questions. While this worked earlier on in the semester, towards the end when other courses also picked up, many students would come and write the test blind without going through the content beforehand. This meant that the flipped classroom reverted to a traditional lecture---missing the point.

More reflection is therefore required on how we can combine the best practices from the pandemic with the way teaching was done before.

### Enabling independent study

When I started teaching, I thought enthusiasm was central to effective teaching (Teaching Philosophy, sub-goal 1). While crucial, I quickly realized that identifying and conveying the threshold concepts and embedding them within the broader context are equally important (sub-goal 2). In the last year, I have come to realize that there is a third aspect which I need to integrate more: how to enable and encourage independent learning in students (a core part of sub-goal 3). Delivering the best, carefully curated content in an enthusiastic way is not enough: we need students to engage with the work themselves, to make it their own. The description of my flipped classroom experience in DatA414 above shows that there aren't quick answers.

I have therefore made the following one of my core questions to reflect on in the future: how can I "intentionally structure modules in a way which requires students to develop independent learning skills" (quote from [Tobi Louw's](https://process.sun.ac.za/staff/all-staff/?entry=12) Teaching Philosophy, 2020).
