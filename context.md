### Teaching in Stellenbosch, South Africa, Africa, the world

I teach at one of the top institutions in Africa. But even here in our relatively wealthy town, we can see the socio-economic challenges facing South Africa and the rest of the continent: inequality, illiteracy, and limitations in access to education. Globally, we will increasingly be faced with the problems of climate change and sustainable energy generation. While I don't have all the answers, I try to show the students how the knowledge they acquire can be used to better understand and address these challenges. As an example, in one of my [DatA414 lectures](https://youtu.be/zu34zcyAFzU?t=80), we look at how the percentage of households with low socioeconomic status in a neighbourhood affects median house prices. As another example, for the 2020 DatA414 course project, students had to develop and implement a model to predict future wind speeds based on past measurements. By showing students the relevance of what they are learning, I hope to create excitement about the material, leading to engagement (Teaching Philosophy, sub-goal 1).

Since broader community engagement is also one of the main purposes of universities within society (Badat, 2009), I have increasingly been trying to reach an even wider audience outside of just my classroom at Stellenbosch. One way I have been doing this is through the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/), one of the largest winter schools in artificial intelligence and machine learning in the world. I was an organizer of the 2018 Indaba at Stellenbosch, attended by around 550 students and researchers. I also taught on speech and natural language processing for low-resource languages at the 2019 Indaba in Kenya. For the 2022 Indaba in Tunisia, I took some of my in-person NLP817 lecture recordings and compiled them in [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmZlBIcArwhPHmHzyM_cZJQ8_v5paQJTV) for the Indaba's natural language processing practical.

The move from classroom to online teaching has also presented a great opportunity to engage more broadly outside of the university. On [my teaching blog](https://www.weaklysupervised.com/), I have reflected specifically on the advantages of [making lecture videos](https://www.weaklysupervised.com/2021/01/15/why-lecture-videos/). I post most of my lecture videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/HermanKamperML), which allows anyone to benefit from these resources. I currently have roughly 1.8k subscribers and several videos with around 10k views. This also allows Stellenbosch students to access these resources after they have graduated. As far as I know, my DatA414 lecture videos are used or referred to in at least four other courses at Stellenbosch University (DatA324, Statistical Learning Theory 812&842, CS E414). I also share example code snippets [such as this one](https://github.com/kamperh/autoencoders_mnist/blob/master/ae_mnist.ipynb) on GitHub. I got the following email from a student not taking any of my courses:

> *I am currently a CS315 student and can't thank you enough for the wonderful content you share so openly on GitHub and YouTube. It really helps. It is amazing how you explain such complicated concepts in an understandable way!* --- Translation of original email in Afrikaans, 2022.

<!-- > *Ek is tans 'n CS 315-student en ek kan jou nie genoeg bedank vir die wonderlike inhoud wat jy so openlik deel op GitHub en Youtube nie, dit help regtig baie. Dis amazing hoe jy sulke ingewikkelde onderwerpe op 'n verstaanbare manier kan verduidelik!* -->

### Students at Stellenbosch

#### Undergraduate students

Since I was an undergraduate student in engineering at Stellenbosch (2006-2009), the composition of classes have changed substantially, with more female students and students of colour joining the faculty. (Despite great strides, this change is still too slow.) This means that we are now teaching to students coming from very different academic, financial, linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Although this can be challenging, it is also a privilege to play a small role in helping these students become engaged citizens---each in their own unique context.

As part of my Teaching Philosophy (sub-goal 1), I believe it is important to make students excited about the work. One way is to give examples speaking to their interests. This is challenging given the diversity of our students. But I have found two areas that almost all students show an interest in: music and language. Within the first week of SS414, I normally put up a sheet on which any student can make recommendations about songs or artists that they enjoy. Since SS414 deals with digital signal processing, most of the concepts can be illustrated on a music signal. Through the semester I would then update my Python demos so that I e.g. apply a new filter to one of the recommended songs. My own research applies machine learning to problems in speech and language processing, and I often show examples from these areas in class. I recall one time where I showcased a model that we developed for Xitsonga. A quiet student, always sitting at the back of the class, jumped up saying: "This is my language!" This student was able to interpret the modelâ€™s output for me and the rest of the class.

#### Final-year and postgraduate students

I have co-supervised and worked with master's students at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Chicago. When I started at Stellenbosch in 2017, I was amazed to find that our final-year and postgraduate students are on par or better than many of the students at these international institutions. Often, instead of giving explicit instructions, my role is simply to remove barriers for these students, just making sure there isn't anything prohibiting them to learn and proceed on their own. I.e., I'm really just [handing them a wand](???).
