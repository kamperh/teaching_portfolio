After completing my bachelor's and master's degrees at [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/), I moved to Scotland, where I did my PhD in Informatics at the [University of Edinburgh](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc). Here I tutored machine learning and natural language processing courses. I then did a postdoc at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](http://www.ttic.edu/), a research laboratory affiliated with the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), where I also taught as a guest lecturer in one of the courses. In July 2017 I returned to Stellenbosch, where I am currently an Associate Professor in the [ Electrical & Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.sun.ac.za/). From 2022 I am also our department's Postgraduate Programme Coordinator.

Between my master's and doctoral degrees, I taught on a contract for one semester at Stellenbosch:

- Applied Mathematics B124 (AMB124)

Since returning to Stellenbosch in 2017, I have taught:

- Computer Programming 143 (CP143)
- Data Analytics 414 (DatA414)
- Systems and Signals 414 (SS414)
- Natural Language Processing 817 (NLP817)

This website states my teaching philosophy, explains how I developed (and continue to develop) this philosophy, and gives examples of how it plays out in practice in the context in which I teach.
